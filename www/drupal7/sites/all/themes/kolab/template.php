/**
 * @file
 * Contains theme override functions and preprocess functions for the theme.
 *
 * ABOUT THE TEMPLATE.PHP FILE
 *
 *   The template.php file is one of the most useful files when creating or
 *   modifying Drupal themes. You can modify or override Drupal's theme
 *   functions, intercept or make additional variables available to your theme,
 *   and create custom PHP logic. For more information, please visit the Theme
 *   Developer's Guide on Drupal.org: http://drupal.org/theme-guide
 *
 * OVERRIDING THEME FUNCTIONS
 *
 *   The Drupal theme system uses special theme functions to generate HTML
 *   output automatically. Often we wish to customize this HTML output. To do
 *   this, we have to override the theme function. You have to first find the
 *   theme function that generates the output, and then "catch" it and modify it
 *   here. The easiest way to do it is to copy the original function in its
 *   entirety and paste it here, changing the prefix from theme_ to shop_.
 *   For example:
 *
 *     original: theme_breadcrumb()
 *     theme override: shop_breadcrumb()
 *
 *   where shop is the name of your sub-theme. For example, the
 *   zen_classic theme would define a zen_classic_breadcrumb() function.
 *
 *   If you would like to override either of the two theme functions used in Zen
 *   core, you should first look at how Zen core implements those functions:
 *     theme_breadcrumbs()      in zen/template.php
 *     theme_menu_local_tasks() in zen/template.php
 *
 *   For more information, please visit the Theme Developer's Guide on
 *   Drupal.org: http://drupal.org/node/173880
 *
 * CREATE OR MODIFY VARIABLES FOR YOUR THEME
 *
 *   Each tpl.php template file has several variables which hold various pieces
 *   of content. You can modify those variables (or add new ones) before they
 *   are used in the template files by using preprocess functions.
 *
 *   This makes THEME_preprocess_HOOK() functions the most powerful functions
 *   available to themers.
 *   It works by having one preprocess function for each template file or its
 *   derivatives (called template suggestions). For example:
 *     THEME_preprocess_page    alters the variables for page.tpl.php
 *     THEME_preprocess_node    alters the variables for node.tpl.php or
 *                              for node-forum.tpl.php
 *     THEME_preprocess_comment alters the variables for comment.tpl.php
 *     THEME_preprocess_block   alters the variables for block.tpl.php
 *
 *   For more information on preprocess functions and template suggestions,
 *   please visit the Theme Developer's Guide on Drupal.org:
 *   http://drupal.org/node/223440
 *   and http://drupal.org/node/190815#template-suggestions
